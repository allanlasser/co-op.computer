# CO-OP: Communal Ownership of Our Posessions

**CO-OP** is a decentralized library system with distributed storage.
It's for borrowing and lending your stuff within trusted networks.

With CO-OP, you can:

1. Create a library of the tools you already own
2. Search your networks for tools you're missing
3. Borrow and lend tools within a network
4. Invite friends to grow your networks

CO-OP starts with tool-sharing, with the intention to support other
categories of property over time (gear, books, cookware).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
